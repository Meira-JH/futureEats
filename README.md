FutureEats is a front-end development of an imaginary web mobile-first application, as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. This was a collective effort imagined, executed and revised by [Ricardo Araújo](https://github.com/araujoricardo), [Igor Delesposti](https://github.com/igordelesposti), [Mário Luz](https://github.com/MarioLuzz), [João Fonseca](https://github.com/joaopf4) and [me](https://github.com/Meira-JH). The design was made by Camila Mizutani.
