# futureEats

FutureEats is a front-end development of an imaginary web mobile-first application as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. This was a collective effort imagined, executed and revised by Ricardo Araújo (araujoricardo), Igor Despolli (igordelesposti), Mário Luz (MarioLuzz), João Fonseca (joaopf4) and me. The design was made by Camila Mizutani.
