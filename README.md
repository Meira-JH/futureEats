Front-end development of an imaginary web mobile-first application as an activity result of Labenu's full-stack development course. This was a collective work, imagined, executed and revised by Ricardo Araújo (araujoricardo), Igor Despolli (igordelesposti), Mário Luz (MarioLuzz) and João Fonseca (joaopf4) and me.
